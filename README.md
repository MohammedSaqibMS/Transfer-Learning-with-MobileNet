# ðŸš€ Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2

This repository demonstrates the implementation of transfer learning using the MobileNetV2 model. It includes key steps such as dataset preprocessing, data augmentation, feature extraction, and model fine-tuning. The code leverages TensorFlow and Keras to showcase the power of transfer learning for image classification tasks.
